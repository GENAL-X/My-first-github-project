## TO GOD 
- for my worship to be true it is important that i am worshiping Him who sits on the throne and the Lamb
-  There are things that seeks your worship so there must be a clear definition of the Object of worship. things like your belly, mammon even your body tried to exhalt it self and seek worship NOw He who seats in the Throne and the Lamb also seeks your worship 
-   Revelation teaches us worship - The 20 and 4 elders casting their       crowns and worshiping saying " worthy is Him who seats on the Throne and the Lamb 
-   when your attention is not on Him, you won't be able to experience the power that should come in worship
-   When we go to God we dont have him in our thought, problems in our mind is our focus, we worship unknown to us that we are commiting idolatery. worship demand thAT THE moment you are in Him presence nothing else matters
